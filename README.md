It is intended to be the love child of the two games Asteroids and Galaga.

It is a 1st person asteroid shooter that allows movement on a 2D plane (X and Z axis), while allowing for rotational freedom in all directions.

There are 3 Bosses: an Arachnoid, a Space Pirate Ship, and an Alien Pyramid.
There are 4 weapon types: Default semi-auto laser, a scattershot, a laser cannon, and a smart missile.

The player begins on a level with a large number of asteroids. Destroying asteroids drops currency and ammo. Destroying a certain number of asteroids will open a wormhole that will allow passage to the boss level.
